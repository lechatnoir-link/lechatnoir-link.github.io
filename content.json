My research focuses on Information Extraction, Knowledge Graph in Natural Language Processing. My research skill is still relatively low now.😅 Thank you for visiting. I have created personal blogs many times before, by myself or using frameworks made by others such as Wordpress, Typecho and Jekyll; However, due to my blind pursuit of dynamic effects, the blog was designed more and more fancy, but the content was more and more empty, and even once the blog was dressed up as a personal love memorial website, making the blog stupid； After a year, I re-build my blog with the encouragement of my friend, the following provisions are made: Only three types of articles will be shared: Summaries of literature in my own research area and related fields; Summaries of techniques accumulated in the course of research, projects and personal practice; Non-regular personal summaries based on todo-list. In the three types of articles: The summary of the literature is required to be understandable and rewarding for those who have relevant research experience. Aka. quality assurance, preferring lack to lack; Technical summaries that I can read and understand, or I can quickly remember when I needs them, but that do not require that others understand the exact meaning; Personal summary requirements to todo-list-based. The blog can be revamped after a certain level of academic or technical achievement in order to “get the details right”; No more fancy plugins, features and pages on top of the current one; I strive to make this blog an accumulative testimony of personal thoughts and techniques, and if I’m busy or have nothing good to offer, I can break off, and perfunctory work is strictly prohibited.
